# One Billion Row Challenge
The data file was generated from the offical 1BRC [here](git@github.com:gunnarmorling/1brc.git)

## Go Implementation

This `golang` implementation is inspired by [this blog post](https://benhoyt.com/writings/go-1brc/) from Ben Hoyt.

## Notes on performance
The baseline version takes about 12s to process 100M rows (~1.5GB) on an M1 Macbook Air (2020)
